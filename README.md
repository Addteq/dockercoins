# dockercoins

This is the demo application used in the [orchestration workshop](https://jpetazzo.github.io/orchestration-workshop).

Note that this version is not updated anymore. It extracted  as a standalone repo to showcase the
`git clone; docker-compose up` workflow, but you should use the version included in the orchestration
workshop [repository](https://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop).
